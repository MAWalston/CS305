Client Needs Interpretation: Understanding Artemis Financial's need for modernizing their operations and ensuring robust software security has taught me the importance of interpreting client requirements accurately. Recognizing potential threats and attacks associated with the application helped in prioritizing security measures.

Value of Secure Communications: Secure communications are crucial for Artemis Financial to protect sensitive financial information and maintain trust with their clients. Recognizing this value underscores the significance of implementing secure communication protocols.

External Threats Consideration: Considering potential external threats, including international transactions and governmental restrictions, highlighted the importance of staying informed about evolving cybersecurity landscapes and compliance requirements.

Modernization Requirements: The project emphasized the need to consider modernization requirements, such as the role of open-source libraries and evolving web application technologies, to ensure the software remains secure and up-to-date.

Identifying Areas of Security: Utilizing the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram helped in identifying relevant areas of security specific to Artemis Financial's web application. Not all areas applied, so focusing on the pertinent ones streamlined the assessment process.

Manual Code Review: Conducting a manual review of the codebase allowed for the identification of vulnerabilities not detected by automated tools. This hands-on approach provided valuable insights into the application's security posture.

Static Testing with Dependency-Check Plugin: Integrating the dependency-check plugin and running static tests provided a comprehensive view of security vulnerabilities in the codebase. Analyzing the dependency-check report enabled the prioritization of mitigation efforts.

Mitigation Planning: Developing a mitigation plan based on the assessment results was essential for addressing identified vulnerabilities effectively. Creating an action list with recommended solutions ensured a structured approach to remediation.

Coding Securely and Checking for New Vulnerabilities: Prioritizing secure coding practices throughout the development process is paramount to mitigate vulnerabilities. After refactoring the code, thorough testing and continuous monitoring are essential to detect and address any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

Resources and Tools Utilization: Leveraging resources like the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, manual code review techniques, static testing tools, and secure coding practices provided valuable insights and methodologies applicable to future assignments or tasks.

Demonstrating Skills to Future Employers: From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to conduct vulnerability assessments, identify security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation plans, and prioritize secure coding practices. These experiences demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and expertise in software security and development, which would be valuable to future employers.
